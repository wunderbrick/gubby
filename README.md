This is my first Haskell project and my first [Reflex-FRP](https://reflex-frp.org/) project. I did the SVG stuff by hand which was silly. It got tedious and I settled for good enough since this is just a learning exercise. The animations/timing of events could use some tweaking and I'd like to clean it up/refactor it if I get a chance.
